# cs297_Blockchain_server_client_Node_project_1
Mock-up of a Blockchain Server-Client node using Javascript.

The endpoints generated are the same endpoints that are called by other popular Blockchains, 
so it's a great way to isolate and understand how a specific node works.
We have created a mock blockchain (mockchain) using an expressJS application. 
Blocks can be mined, transactions can be generated, and they'll be printed to the user. To this end, a singular node is pivoted towards the user's view.

It means that the Mockchain will be viewable in the browser, easily. You'll be able to mine blocks of your own design, generate faux transactions, and view how the chain is structured individually.
